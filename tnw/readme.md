#The Next Web (Responsive Design)

I completed this project for the Responsive Design project, in the Odin Project's course on HTML/CSS. You can find the details of the assignment on [the Odin Project's website](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-responsive-design).

You can see my work [in your browser here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ubershibs/odin-html-css/blob/master/tnw/index.html).
